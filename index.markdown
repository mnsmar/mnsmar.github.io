Computational biology enthusiast and currently Research Associate at the
University of Pennsylvania. This fall, I will be starting my lab at the
National Institute on Aging at NIH to follow my vision to understand the
genome, decipher how dysregulation of biological processes leads to disease
and discover novel avenues for precision medicine.  My interests revolve
around data-driven biology and genomics, machine learning, systems biology,
and large-scale data analysis.
