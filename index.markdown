I'm a bioinformatician that works on small RNA biology and RNA binding
proteins. I work with high throughput sequencing data and program in Perl, Go and
R.

As an undergrad I studied Biology and Physics and later in my studies I was
thrilled by Computer Science. In my undergrad thesis, I developed a
computational model to simulate how signals transmit through neurons.

In my PhD I worked on RNA biology and developed bioinformatics tools to
predict miRNA gene targets and integrate miRNAs in gene regulatory networks.

Now as a postdoctoral fellow, I analyze RNA-Seq and HITS-CLIP data to study
small RNAs (piRNAs, miRNAs) and RNA binding proteins. I'm interested in
deciphering the role of RNA binding proteins in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
(ALS) and their effect on the neurons.
