Stadtman Tenure-Track Investigator at National Institute on Aging, NIH. My lab
(Computational Genomics Unit) is trying to understand RNA dynamics, gene
regulation and how dysregulation of biological processes leads to disease. My
overarching goal is to discover novel avenues for precision medicine in
aging-associated diseases. My interests revolve around genomics, data-driven
biology, machine learning, systems biology, and large-scale data analysis.
