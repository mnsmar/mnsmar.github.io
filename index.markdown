I am currently a Research Associate at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn).
My overarching research vision is to employ bioinformatics to understand the
genome, decipher how dysregulation of biological processes leads to disease and
discover novel avenues for precision medicine. My research interests revolve
around data-driven biology, genomics, machine learning, systems biology, and
large-scale data analysis. I have studied Physics, Biology and Computer
Science and navigated my research at the boundaries of biology and
informatics. My overarching aim is to develop novel, state-of-the-art,
computational tools to mine and integrate multidimensional biological and
biomedical data to discover new biology and address fundamental questions in
biology and medicine.
