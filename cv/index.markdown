# Education

**Martin Luther Universität Halle Wittenberg, Germany &  
Biomedical Science Research Center “Alexander Fleming”, Greece**

[2007 - 2011] *PhD in Bioinformatics*

Advisor: Prof. Dr. Ivo Grosse & Dr. Artemis Hatzigeorgiou.

Dissertation title: Bioinformatics approach for microRNA target prediction and
functional analysis.

Highlights: Development of one of the most accurate miRNA target predictions
programs, DIANA-microT and integration of miRNA targeting into biological
pathways. Association of gene expression profiles with miRNA function.
Prediction of viral miRNA targets and use of high throughput sequencing data
to train machine learning approaches for higher accuracy and target prediction
in coding sequences. Incorporation of high throughput sequencing data and
bibliographic information in TarBase. Integration of all tools in a highly
accessed web-server.

**National Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece**

[2002 - 2007] *Bachelor of Science in Physics*

Thesis advisor: Dr. Aris Moustakas.

Thesis title: Computational simulation of signal transmission to the brain through the neurons.

Specialization: Electronics, Computer systems, Telecommunications and Automation.

**National Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece**

[2001 - 2002] *First year Bachelor of Science in Biology*

Attended first year classes in Biology department. 

# Experience

**University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine, USA**

[2011 - Present] Postdoctoral Fellow, Zissimos Mourelatos, MD lab

Bioinformatics analysis of RNA regulation, small RNAs (miRNAs, piRNAs), RNA
binding proteins in normal cellular function and RNA dysregulation in human
diseases. Analysis of high-throughput sequencing data from immunoprecipitated
and crosslinked RNA (HITS-CLIP) and RNA-Seq data. Development of open source
bioinformatics tools and programming framework for the efficient analysis of
sequencing data. Study piRNA biogenesis and silencing pathway. Study
implications of RNA binding proteins (FUS, TAF15, TDP-43, EWS) in Amyotrophic
Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and investigate their effect on the neuronal
transcriptome.
